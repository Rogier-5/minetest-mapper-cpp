IANAL, but it seems to me that:

The original code, (c) Miroslav Bendík contained a file 'LICENSE', stating that
the code was LGPLv2.1 licensed. The original code therefore has this license.

On 23 feb 2014, Miroslav added the file 'COPYING', containing the BSD 2-clause
license, to his source tree, without removing the LGPLv2.1+ license file.
Presumably, this means that all his code should be considered dual-licensed.

ShadowNinja's contributions predate this, and are based on an earlier version
of Miroslav's work anyway, so his contributions should necessarily be licensed
LGPLv2.1+ as well.
There is no indication that his contributions are licensed under any other
license (in particular: not under the BSD 2-clause license).

Sfan5 made a few contributions on top of ShadowNinja's version, and on 5 mar 2014,
added the file 'COPYING' with the BSD 2-clause license as well.
Presumably, all his contributions can therefore be considered dual-licensed:
LGPLv2.1+ and BSD 2-clause.

Rogier's contributions are licensed and (re)usable subject to any of the following
licenses:
