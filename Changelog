    General: integrated all (relevant) patches from the minetest/minetestmapper tree
    	(only patches that actually conflict with my work were obviously not merged)

    Features:
    	- redis backend support (merged from minetest/minetestmapper)
		The code was ported and compiles. Unfortunately, I wasn't able
		to test against a redis database yet.
	- The database backend to use is now obtained from the world.mt file by default
	- Additional geometrical figures can be drawn on the map
		Similar to the circles drawn for origin and players. Supported figures
		are: point, line, rectangle, ellipse (circle), text.
		Translucency (alpha) is supported, although for ellipses, it does not
		work as expected (due to a bug in libgd)

    Enhancements:
    	- Failure to process a command-line option now causes a specific error message.
		The generic help message is often not very helpful in such a case.
    	- The map origin color and Player colors can now be specified with an alpha value.
		Unfortunately, due to a bug in libgd, the effect is not what it should be...
	- The colors.txt file is now also searched for in the world's minetest directory
		(the directory containing minetest.conf) - if it can be found.
	- C++11 compilation is enabled if supported. If so, faster datastructures are used.
		instead of regular map, unordered_map is used where applicable
	- Colors used with drawalpha can now differ from colors used without drawalpha.
		Colors.txt can now have 'duplicate' entries for nodes, depending on whether alpha
		transparency is on or off.
		With 'drawalpha', a non-opaque color entry (with alpha less than 255) is
		preferred, whereas without 'drawalpha', a color entry with alpha 255
		(or unspecified alpha) is preferred.
		In all other cases, later entries override former entries in the colors file.
		The color of water with drawalpha was changed a little.
	- The sqlite3 backend is now optional and can be disabled during compilation.
	- Failures parsing or decompressing the block data from the database are now caught and reported.
		Map generation continues, and aborts only after 100 or more errors.
		The error messages for decompression failures were also improved.
	- Geometry can now also be specified using 2 corners of the area (instead of corner and dimensions)
	- The configuration of tiles location was improved

    Bugfixes:
    	- When not using a geometry option, *do* generate the smallest possible map
	- Fix transparency computation - libgd uses 0..127 (not 255)
	- Using an invalid option name no longer causes a crash, but is reported.
	- Fixed a crash when the top part of the generated map is empty
	- The computation of map size with tiles was fixed (height could be miscomputed)
    	
[16 apr 2014]
    General: integrated all (relevant) patches from the minetest/minetestmapper tree
    	(only patches that actually conflict with my work were obviously not merged)

    Features:
    	- A grid can now be added to the map ( with '--tiles')
		Gridlines are drawn 'between' map rows/columns, and therefore do
		not obscure map data. (as a consequence, straight lines may not look
		straight where they cross gridlines).
	- Alpha transparency was added (merged from minetest/minetestmapper)
		Some improvements and fixes were added to make it work as expected
	- An option was added to print progress information during map generation
		This prints the z-coordinate of every block-row being rendered.
	- The map geometry can now be specified with node-granularity
		The geometry is no longer always rounded away from zero, to a multiple of 16.
		I.e. requesting a 80x82 map will result in a 80x82 map, not a 80x96 map
		(or even 96x112).
		The old behavior (i.e. block-granularity) is still available as well.
	- The colors.txt file is now searched for in different locations
		The mapper looks in the world directory for a colors.txt file by default
		Alternatively, the colors.txt file in $HOME/.minetest is used if it exists.
		A colors.txt file in the current directory is a last resort case, and causes a
		warning message.

    Enhancements:
    	- Colors.txt is no longer included in the executable (merged from minetest/minetestmapper)
	- Option and colors parsing failures are handled more gracefully
	
    Bugfixes:
    	- The computation of origin location and player locations was fixed (off-by-one)
	- Colors.txt is now parsed line-by-line, and errors are reported.
		Errors no longer cause the remainder of the file to be silently ignored.
	- A failure to create the image for lack of memory is now caught.
		When a lack of memory is to be expected during image generation, a warning is printed
		before image generation starts.
	- The handling of an alpha component in colors was fixed
	
[26 mar 2014]

    Features:
	- A map of the *requested* size can now be generated (after rounding to blocks)
		The option --forcegeometry makes sure the map is not reduced in size if the
		world is smaller than the requested geometry.
		Rounding to a multiple of the block size (i.e. 16) still happens.

    Enhancements:
	- The size of the map is not limited by default
		By default, only part of the world was included in the map
	- Performance was significantly improved
	- An ability to report the sizes of the world and of the map was added

    Bugfixes:
	- Fix geometry so that w and h are the map dimensions
	- Vertical limits handling (--min-y and --max-y) was fixed, and now works as expected
	- Failure to open the output file is now caught and handled gracefully
	- The computation of block number bounds was fixed (off-by-one)
